AI Search - search images using descriptions

A simple Python console application that indexes and searches collections of images.

The index will be stored in the root of the given start folder. It will index all images files under that folder recursively. When images are added it will index those too.

It uses https://github.com/ManuelFay/ImageSearcher for the indexing and search.
